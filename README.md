# APS105-Code-Tester

A series of code tester for all the labs from the University of Toronto APS105 course.

Every week the repository will be updatedto include the latest lab's solution.

Steps for testing your code:
    1. change you code's name to test.c and move it into the main folder.
    2. run the code_tester.py code from terminal using the following command:
        python code_tester.py

Warning: The files in the test_files folder are all related to the unit testing of the main code, do not make any changes to them or else the program could run into major issues.

P.S. Currently this tester can only be run in a linux environment.
